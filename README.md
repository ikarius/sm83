# Sharp SM83 emulator 

**Disclaimer**: This is a hobby/learning project and will be work in progress for an undefined amount of time (you've been warned :)).

This is a _non-accurate_ (yet) Sharp SM83 emulator written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org) that can be used in other projects and bundled with other languages (the main target being [Go](https://go.dev)).

## Build 

```zig build```

## Tests

Test target relies on [this test suite](https://github.com/SingleStepTests/sm83). 

Just checkout the repo in the `tests` directory and run `zig test` 

## License

This source code is free to use, copy and modify (if you ever want to).
